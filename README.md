# 🌦️ Weather Castor Prank 😂

Welcome to **Weather Castor Prank**, the ultimate **weather prediction troll website**!  
It pretends to fetch real weather data, loads a fancy UI, and then *bam*—asks users to **look outside** for the most "accurate" forecast. 🌍👀

---

## 🎭 **How It Works**
1️⃣ **User enters their location** 📍  
2️⃣ **Fake high-tech loading screen appears** (satellites, sensors, AI—totally fake 🤖)  
3️⃣ **After some time, a prank message pops up** saying:  
   > **"The real weather is right outside your window!"** 🤣  
4️⃣ **User realizes they got trolled** (optional: they throw their phone in frustration)
